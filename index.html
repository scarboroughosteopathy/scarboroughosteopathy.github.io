    <h3>Osteopathic treatment at Perth's best beach</h3>
    <h2>Welcome to Scarborough Osteopathy, Perth</h2>
    <p>
      At Scarborough Osteopathy we offer a patient-centred approach to
      healthcare, focusing on how the skeleton, joints, muscles, circulation,
      connective tissue and internal organs function together smoothly as a
      unit. We recognise the important link between the structure of the body
      and the way it functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our practitioners approach treatment by incorporating a range of
      osteopathic techniques, direct hands-on treatment, dry needling, and
      specific rehabilitation advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any treatment will, of course, be fully explained, discussed and agreed
      with the patient before starting any procedure.

        <h3>About the Practitioner: Dr. Elizabeth Jury M.Ost</h3>
        <h2>Meet Liz</h2>
        <p>
          Originally from England, I graduated with a Masters degree from The
          British School of Osteopathy, widely recognised as the leading
          provider of osteopathic education in Europe. I worked for several
          years in central London before moving to Perth in 2014 seeking a
          warmer climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not treating patients, I practice the lifestyle I preach. I love
          being fit and active myself; my passions include kitesurfing,
          swimming, golf, pilates, running and free diving. Consequently, I
          absolutely understand the importance of enabling patients to return to
          the hobbies they love and to help them heal any injuries as quickly as
          possible. I achieve this through a range of osteopathic techniques,
          direct hands-on treatment and specific rehabilitation advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also fully qualified and experienced in other treatment methods
          such as dry-needling, K-tape strapping and visceral manipulation. I
          also have experience treating headaches, and can cater specifically
          for pregnant women.

        <h3>About the Practitioner: Dr Alex Mann BHSc, BAppSc (Osteopathy)</h3>
        <h2>Meet Alex</h2>
        <p>
          Originally from Melbourne, I qualified as an Osteopath from RMIT. My
          passion for healthcare started in early adulthood after sustaining
          sports injuries and being exposed to the benefits of osteopathy first
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming from a clinic in Croydon, I relocated to sunny Perth in 2023,
          where I continue to enjoy helping patients of all ages and
          backgrounds. I'm passionate about working with patients to create an
          individual, goal oriented treatment plan, enabling them to get back to
          doing what they love without pain. I accomplish this with a broad
          range of hands-on treatment techniques, dry needling, and
          patient-specific exercise prescription. I like to treat a wide range
          of conditions, but do have a special interest in managing lower back
          pain, neck pain, and acute injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the outdoors, so outside of the clinic, you will find me out at
          the beach, on the golf course, or travelling up and down the coast to
          find some cracking camping spots!

        <h3>About the Practitioner: Dr. Addison Levens</h3>
        <h2>Meet Addison</h2>
        <p>
          Originally from the UK, I graduated with a Master's degree and
          postgraduate in paediatrics from the British School Of Osteopathy. In
          2017 my wife and I decided to pack up our lives and head for the
          amazing lifestyle Perth has to offer.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing I appreciate from my life is being able to help those in
          their times of need. Osteopathy has enabled me to fulfill my
          empathetic capability when treating those who experience acute or
          chronic pain. I am lucky enough to be able to help all ages from my
          youngest patient being 1 day old to my eldest patient of 101 years
          young! I also have experience treating pregnant women and looking
          after them in postpartum.
        </p>

        <p>
          I find great joy in getting to know my patient's goals and helping
          them achieve them through a holistic approach, where I utilise various
          hands on osteopathic techniques. I am also qualified in using other
          treatment methods such as K tape strapping and trigger point dry
          needling. I use different treatment modalities as I understand
          everybody is different, and should be treated according to their own
          injury and experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time you'll find me either at the gym practising what I
          preach, at the beach for mindfulness, or laughing with mates when
          hitting balls into trees on the golf course!

    <h2>What is Osteopathy?</h2>
    <div class="newspaper">
      <p>
        Osteopathy is a holistic or “whole body” manual therapy specialising in
        identifying and treating mechanical dysfunction within the body, which
        generally occurs as a result of injury, stress, postural breakdown or
        disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Osteopaths use a wide range of hands on techniques to enhance the body’s
        function, such as massage, stretching, myofascial release, joint
        manipulation and dry needling. Your individual treatment will be
        tailored to you and only include what you are comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to allow you to effectively achieve your goals and put you in
        charge of your pain in the least time possible. Home exercises and
        lifestyle advice will be given to aid recovery, promote health and
        prevent symptoms reoccurring.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means fewer visits to the clinic and more time enjoying a pain free
        lifestyle ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Osteopaths are primary healthcare practitioners and are registered under
        the national registration body AHPRA. Osteopathy is covered under most
        major health funds and by Medicare’s CDM (Chronic Disease Management)
        plans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Osteopathic practitioners can also detect conditions that are not
        treatable through Osteopathy and refer patients to other specialists.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h2>New Patients - what to expect:</h2>
      <p>
        You do not need a referral to visit the clinic. Call or email us to book
        an initial appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be asked questions about your presenting problem, your
        symptoms, about your health in general and your health history. A full
        osteopathic assessment will be conducted involving clinical tests where
        appropriate. This may involve diagnostic, orthopaedic or neurological
        tests, postural assessments, movement and functional assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Osteopathy takes a holistic approach to treatment, the osteopath
        may look at other parts of your body, as well as the symptomatic area.
        For example, if you have a sore knee, the Osteopath may also look at
        your ankle, pelvis and back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment options and procedures will be explained and discussed with
        the patient. If appropriate, there may be a form of hands on treatment,
        manipulation, dry-needling, K-tape strapping etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be provided with advice, exercises or education to help you
        manage your condition between appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment may be subsidised by your health fund. We offer HICAPS and
        Medicare rebated treatment plans for eligible patients. DVA and work
        cover / insurance claims are also available.
