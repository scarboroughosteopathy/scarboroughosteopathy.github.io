      <h3>About the Practitioner: Dr. Elizabeth Jury M.Ost</h3>
      <h2>Meet Liz</h2>
      <p>Originally from England, I graduated with a Masters degree from The British School of Osteopathy, widely recognised as the leading provider of osteopathic education in Europe. I worked for several years in central London before moving to Perth in 2014 seeking a warmer climate.</p>
      <p>When not treating patients, I practice the lifestyle I preach. I love being fit and active myself; my passions include kitesurfing, swimming, golf, pilates, running and free diving. Consequently, I absolutely understand the importance of enabling patients to return to the hobbies they love and to help them heal any injuries as quickly as possible. I achieve this through a range of osteopathic techniques, direct hands-on treatment and specific rehabilitation advice.</p>
      <p>I am also fully qualified and experienced in other treatment methods such as dry-needling, K-tape strapping and visceral manipulation. Any treatment will, of course, be fully explained, discussed and agreed with the patient before starting any treatment procedure.</p>

    <h2>What is Osteopathy?</h2>
    <div class="newspaper">
      <p>Osteopathy is a holistic or “whole body” manual therapy specialising in identifying and treating mechanical dysfunction within the body, which generally occurs as a result of injury, stress, postural breakdown or disease.</p>
      <p>Osteopaths use a wide range of hands on techniques to enhance the body’s function, such as massage, stretching, myofascial release, joint manipulation and dry needling. Your individual treatment will be tailored to you and only include what you are comfortable with.</p>
      <p>We aim to allow you to effectively achieve your goals and put you in charge of your pain in the least time possible. Home exercises and lifestyle advice will be given to aid recovery, promote health and prevent symptoms reoccurring.</p>
      <p>This means fewer visits to the clinic and more time enjoying a pain free lifestyle ASAP.</p>
      <p>Osteopaths are primary healthcare practitioners and are registered under the national registration body AHPRA. Osteopathy is covered under most major health funds and by Medicare’s CDM (Chronic Disease Management) plans.</p>
      <p>Osteopathic practitioners can also detect conditions that are not treatable through Osteopathy and refer patients to other specialists.</p>
      <p>To make an appointment with Scarborough Osteopathy you can <a href="https://scarborough-osteopathy.cliniko.com/bookings" target="_blank">book online</a> or give our reception a call.</p>

      <h2>New Patients - what to expect:</h2>
      <p>You do not need a referral to visit the clinic. Call or email us to book an initial appointment.</p>
      <p>You will be asked questions about your presenting problem, your symptoms, about your health in general and your health history. A full osteopathic assessment will be conducted involving clinical tests where appropriate. This may involve diagnostic, orthopaedic or neurological tests, postural assessments, movement and functional assessments.</p>
      <p>Because Osteopathy takes a holistic approach to treatment, the osteopath may look at other parts of your body, as well as the symptomatic area. For example, if you have a sore knee, the Osteopath may also look at your ankle, pelvis and back.</p>
      <p>Treatment options and procedures will be explained and discussed with the patient. If appropriate, there may be a form of hands on treatment, manipulation, dry-needling, K-tape strapping etc.</p>
      <p>You may be provided with advice, exercises or education to help you manage your condition between appointments.</p>
      <p>Treatment may be subsidised by your health fund. We offer HICAPS and Medicare rebated treatment plans for eligible patients. DVA and work cover / insurance claims are also available.</p>
